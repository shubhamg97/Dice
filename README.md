# Dice
A simple six sided die applet in C++

This is a simple six sided die applet I created in C++. The purpose for creation was to use it as a dice for board games and I realized it would be very simple to create one myself. The advantage of this die is that it's simple to use and it's impervious to wear and tear, as opposed to physical dice, that may result in certain numbers more frequently. The application is easy to use and can be utilized over terminal or and IDE. All you need to do to roll the die is to press enter. Much easier than any other dice that I know!

## Instructions for use

### Terminal
1. Open your command-line interpreter of choice (`cmd` or `terminal`)
2. First make the file with the following operations:  
  i. Type in `g++ -o exe dice.cpp` to create an executable  
  ii. Now type in `./exe` to run the file on your CLI
3. Ask away!

### IDE
1) Open the code through an IDE (eg Visual Studio)
2) Now build it (Literally...there should be an operation to build it)
3) And finally run it!
